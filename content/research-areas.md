### Research Interests
My research interests include **autonomous navigation** and **positioning** in robotics. 
In a broader sense, I am interested in how things see and understand the world utilizing different sensor measurements. As well as practical implementation, I hope to pursue the fundamental background of estimation, such as **Bayesian estimation theory** and **Statistical Inference**, in depth.

I started my research journey for **autonomous navigation** when I was an undergraduate student at KAIST.
Projects I worked on as an undergraduate researcher include: 
- [UAV Path Planning][def3]
- Vision-based precision landing of fixed-wing UAVs
- Subway positioning using passengers’ mobile phone sensors 



#### *Graduate Research* 
Following completion of those projects, it seemed natural for me to pursue a master's degree to research navigation in depth, which led me to research GNSS, the most elemental and fundamental positioning technique. To date, I have worked on the following projects as a master’s student.

- [Urban positioning using Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-based GNSS systems][def]

- GNSS integrity assurance 
- [Ionospheric modeling][def2] 
- LEO-PNT
- Software-defined Receiver (SDR)

More details of these projects can be seen [**here**](https://jaeryounglee.github.io/project-summary/).


#### *Advancing to Doctoral Research ...* 
During my PhD studies, I aim to leverage my background in autonomous navigation and estimation theory to explore technologies in control and guidance systems. While my primary focus is on sensor fusion, localization, and decision-making for navigation, I am eager to expand my expertise beyond navigation into broader applications of estimation and inference. I see strong connections between these fields, as the principles of statistical estimation and inference are widely applicable across various engineering domains. I look forward to addressing emerging challenges in estimation and contributing innovative solutions in both navigation and broader engineering applications.
