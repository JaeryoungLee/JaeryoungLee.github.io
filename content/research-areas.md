## Research Interests
My research interests include **autonomous navigation** and **positioning in robotics**. 
In a broader sense, I am interested in how things see and understand the world utilizing different sensor measurements. As well as practical implementation, I hope to pursue the fundamental background of estimation, such as **Bayesian estimation theory**, in depth. 


## Research Journey

### Undergraduate Research
I started my research journey for autonomous navigation when I was an undergraduate student at KAIST.
Projects I worked on as an undergraduate researcher include: 
- UAV Path Planning
- Vision-based precision landing of fixed-wing UAVs
- Subway positioning using passengers’ mobile phone sensors. 
More details of these projects can be seen here: (link). 


### Graduate Research 
Following completion of those projects, it seemed natural for me to pursue a master's degree to research navigation in depth, which led me to research GNSS, the most elemental and fundamental positioning technique. To date, I have worked on the following projects as a master’s student. (link)
- Urban positioning using Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-based GNSS systems
- GNSS integrity assurance 
- Ionospheric modeling 
- LEO-PNT
- Software-defined Receiver (SDR)


### Advancing to Doctoral Research ... 
During my PhD studies, I aim to leverage my background in autonomous navigation and estimation theory to explore a range of technologies in control and guidance systems. While my primary interests lie in sensor fusion, state estimation, and decision-making, I am excited to remain open to new opportunities and emerging challenges within these fields. I look forward to expanding my expertise and contributing to innovative solutions that advance autonomous system capabilities.
