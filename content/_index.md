         My research interests include autonomous navigation and positioning in robotics. In a broader sense, I am interested in how things see and understand the world utilizing different sensor measurements. As well as practical implementation, I hope to pursue the fundamental background of estimation, such as Bayesian estimation theory and Statistical Inference, in depth.
